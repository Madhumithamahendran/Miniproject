## Title of the Project
Pet Guardian Ai

## About
Our project, Pet Guardian AI, is an AI-powered system designed to monitor and assess pets' health conditions based on user inputs. It uses a trained machine learning model to determine if the pet is in a normal or critical state. By integrating a web interface with Flask, users can easily interact with the system. The goal is to provide timely alerts to ensure pets receive necessary care. This project aims to assist pet owners in maintaining their pets' well-being efficiently

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
1.Health Condition Prediction: Uses AI to assess whether the pet is in a normal or critical state based on input data.
2.User-Friendly Interface: A web-based interface built with Flask for easy interaction and accessibility.
3.Machine Learning Integration: Trained ML model ensures accurate health assessments.
4.Timely Alerts: Notifies users when immediate care is required for the pet.
5.Enhanced Pet Care Management: Helps pet owners monitor their pets' health efficiently and take proactive actions.

## Requirements
1.Programming Languages: Python for machine learning and Flask for the web interface.
2.Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model to classify the pet’s condition as normal or critical.
3.Dataset: A reliable dataset for training and testing the model to ensure accuracy.
4.Web Framework: Flask for building and hosting the user-friendly web interface.
5.Hardware & Software: A system with Python installed, and optionally a server or cloud platform to deploy the application..
